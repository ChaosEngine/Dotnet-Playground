# Entity Framework 6.x

Entity Framework 6.x (EF6.x) is a tried and tested data access technology with many years of features and stabilization. It first released in 2008, as part of .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Visual Studio 2008 SP1. Starting with the EF4.1 release it has shipped as the [EntityFramework NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/) - currently the most popular package on NuGet.org.
