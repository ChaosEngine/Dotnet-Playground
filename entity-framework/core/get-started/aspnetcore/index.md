# Getting Started on ASP.NET Core

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple ASP.NET Core application that queries and saves data from a database. You can chose a tutorial that creates a model based on an existing database, or creates a database for you based on your model.

You can find the ASP.NET Core documentation at [docs.asp.net](https://docs.asp.net).
