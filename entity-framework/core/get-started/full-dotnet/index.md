# Getting Started on Full .NET (Console, WinForms, WPF, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple .NET Framework Console Application that queries and saves data from a database. You can chose a tutorial that creates a model based on an existing database, or creates a database for you based on your model.

You can use the techniques learned in these tutorials in any application that targets the .NET Framework, including WPF and WinForms.
