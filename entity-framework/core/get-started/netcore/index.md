# Getting Started on .NET Core (Windows, OSX, Linux, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple .NET Core Console Application that queries and saves data from a database. The tutorials can be completed on any platform supported by .NET Core (Windows, OSX, Linux, etc.).

You can find the .NET Core documentation at [docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/).
