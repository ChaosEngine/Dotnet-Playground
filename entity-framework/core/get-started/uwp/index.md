# Getting Started on Universal Windows Platform

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple Universal Window Platform (UWP) application that queries and saves data from a database.

You can find the UWP documentation at [developer.microsoft.com/windows/uwp](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/uwp).
