# Including & Excluding Types

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../ef6/index.md).

Including a type in the model means that EF has metadata about that type and will attempt to read and write instances from/to the database.

## Conventions

By convention, types that are exposed in `DbSet` properties on your context are included in your model. In addition, types that are mentioned in the `OnModelCreating` method are also included. Finally, any types that are found by recursively exploring the navigation properties of discovered types are also included in the model.

**For example, in the following code listing all three types are discovered:**

* `Blog` because it is exposed in a `DbSet` property on the context

* `Post` because it is discovered via the `Blog.Posts` navigation property

* `AuditEntry` because it is mentioned in `OnModelCreating`

````csharp
class MyContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<AuditEntry>();
    }
}

public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }

    public List<Post> Posts { get; set; }
}

public class Post
{
    public int PostId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }

    public Blog Blog { get; set; }
}

public class AuditEntry
{
    public int AuditEntryId { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Action { get; set; }
}

## Data Annotations

You can use Data Annotations to exclude a type from the model.

<!-- [!code-csharp[Main](samples/core/Modeling/DataAnnotations/Samples/IgnoreType.cs?highlight=9)] -->
````csharp
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }

    public BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }
}

[NotMapped]
public class BlogMetadata
{
    public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }
}
````

## Fluent API

You can use the Fluent API to exclude a type from the model.

<!-- [!code-csharp[Main](samples/core/Modeling/FluentAPI/Samples/IgnoreType.cs?highlight=7)] -->
````csharp
class MyContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Ignore<BlogMetadata>();
    }
}

public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Url { get; set; }

    public BlogMetadata Metadata { get; set; }
}

public class BlogMetadata
{
    public DateTime LoadedFromDatabase { get; set; }
}
